# KRAILAB<br><br>
HERE 1 .pynb file will be uploaded, all below 5 progarms code are there.
<br><br>

1) Find the correlation matrix.<br>

2) Plot the correlation plot on dataset and visualize giving an overview of relationships among data on iris data.<br>

 3)  Apply linear regression Model techniques to predict the data on any dataset.<br>

4) Apply logical regression Model techniques to predict the data on any dataset.<br>

5) KNN<br>

Here KRAIlab.pynb have programs expect above five.
5.	Write a program to use Clustering algorithms for unsupervised Classification. 
6.	Write a program to use Association algorithms for supervised classification on any dataset. 
7.	Write a program for Developing and implementing the Decision Tree model on the dataset. 
9.	Write a program for SVM classification on any dataset. 
10.	Write a program to implement ANN. 
11.	Write a program for Creating and visualizing Neural Networks for the given data. (Use python).
